# Social Buzz Content Analysis

This project is a part of the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage, a virtual experience program designed to simulate real-world data analytics challenges faced by Accenture's clients. In this simulation, I took on the role of a Data Analyst advising a hypothetical social media client, Social Buzz.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project were:

1. Audit Social Buzz's big data practices.
2. Provide recommendations for a successful IPO.
3. Identify the top 5 most popular content categories on the platform.

## Dataset

The project provided 7 datasets containing information about Social Buzz's user activities, content characteristics and engagement metrics. These datasets formed the foundation for understanding the platform's content trends and user preferences.

## Approach

To address the project objectives, I followed a structured approach involving data understanding, cleaning, modeling, analysis  and uncovering insights from the 7 datasets provided. 

## Key Findings

1.A total of 16 unique content categories were identified on Social Buzz.

2.The top-performing category, with 74,000 posts, was related to animals.

3.May emerged as the month with the highest volume of posts.

4.The top 5 categories of content on Social Buzz were Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology and Foods.

## Key Learnings
This project provided me with hands-on experience in working with large datasets, cleaning and modeling data and deriving meaningful insights through analysis. It deepened my understanding of the data analytics process and the importance of effective data visualization in communicating findings to stakeholders.
